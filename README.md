# Djangoproject ...😁😁

# Project on Travel Web page using Django.

Django is a web application framework for Python. It is designed to prioritize principles of reusability and rapid development.

Because Django was developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, it was designed to make common Web-development tasks fast and easy.

Lets go....To start 

First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.

If Django is installed, you should see the version of your installation.

 #  $ python -m django --version
   
# Creating a project

If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

  # $ django-admin startproject mysite(your project name)
  
The development server

Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following commands:

  # $ python manage.py runserver
  
Now that the server’s running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your Web browser. You’ll see a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket taking off. It worked!
